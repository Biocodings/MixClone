It takes next-generation \r\nsequencing data of paired normal-tumor samples as input and integrates \r\nsequence information from both somatic copy number alterations and allele\r\nfrequencies within a unified probabilistic framework. If you have any \r\nquestions, please email yil8@uci.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n-------------\r\n**Mandatory** \r\n\r\n* Python (2.7). [Python 2.7.3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/) is recommended.\r\n\r\n* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)(>=1.6.1). You can download the source of Numpy from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/).\r\n\r\n* [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)(>=0.10). You can download the source of Scipy from [here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/).\r\n\r\n* [Pysam](https://code.google.com/p/pysam/)(>=0.7). To install Pysam, you also need to install [Cython](http://cython.org/) first. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Optional** \r\n* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)(>=1.2.0) is required for a few visualization tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough not mandatory, Linux system is recommended. Also, [samtools](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/) is not required by MixClone, but can be useful for creating bam, bam index and fasta index files which are required by the pysam module of MixClone. \r\n\r\nInstall from source\r\n-------------------\r\nDownload the compressed source file MixClone-*.tar.gz and do as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ tar -xzvf MixClone-*.tar.gz\r\n$ cd MixClone-*\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you prefer to install MixClone other than the default directory, you can also use this command:\r\n```\r\n$ python setup.py install --prefix /home/yili/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also a `bin/` folders under MixClone-*. The `bin/` folder contains useful utilities, such as the R code to run [BICseq](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/PNAS11.html) and the python script to convert BICseq results to BED file. You can copy these two folders somewhere easily accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n=====\r\n\r\n\r\nOverview\r\n--------\r\nMixClone is composed of three modules: \r\n* `preprocess`. Preprocess the reads aliments of paired normal-tumor samples in BAM format, the tumor genome segmentation file in BED format, and produce the *.MixClone.input.pkl file as output, which will be used for running the model.\r\n \r\n* `run_model`. Take the *.MixClone.input.pkl as input, estimate the subclonal cellular prevalence, the absolute copy number and the allelic configuration of each segment, and produce the *.MixClone.output.pkl file as output, which will be used for postprocessing. If the user runs the model without specifying the number of subclonal populations, MixClone will run the model five times with subclonal number ranges from 1 to 5, and recommend the most likely model.\r\n\r\n* `postprocess`. Take the *.MixClone.output.pkl file as input, and extract various output files, including the segments file with estimated parameters, the allele counts file, the subclonal analysis summary and a few plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTumor genome segmentation\r\n-------------------------\r\nMixClone requires a segmentation file of the tumor genome in BED format before running the package. We used [BICseq](http://compbio.med.harvard.edu/Supplements/PNAS11.html) in the original paper. To run a BICseq analysis, you can copy the commands in `bin/BICseq.R` (Li, Y., Xie, X. 2014, Bioinformatics) and paste them in a R interative shell. Or you can also run the R script from the command line:\r\n```\r\n$ R CMD BATCH bin/BICseq.R\r\n```\r\nNote that,`normal.bam` and `tumor.bam` must be in the same directory where you run the command. The R script will output a segments file `segments.BICseq`. Then you can use the other script `bin/BICseq2bed.py` (Li, Y., Xie, X. 2014, Bioinformatics) to convert the segments file into BED format:\r\n```\r\n$ BICseq2bed.py segments.BICseq segments.bed --seg_length 1000000\r\n```\r\n\r\n**--seg_length** Only convert segments with length longer than the threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreprocess\r\n----------\r\nThis part of README is based on [JoinSNVMix](https://code.google.com/p/joint-snv-mix/wiki/runningOld). To preprocess the paired cancer sequencing data, execute:\r\n```\r\n$ MixClone.py preprocess REFERENCE_GENOME.fasta SEGMENTS.bed NORMAL.bam TUMOUR.bam INPUT_BASENAME --min_depth 20 --min_base_qual 10 --min_map_qual 10 --process_num 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n**REFERENCE_GENOME.fasta** The path to the fasta file that the paired BAM files aligned to. Currently, only the\r\n[UCSC](https://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQformat.html#format1) and [ENSEMBL](http://uswest.ensembl.org/info/website/upload/bed.html) chromosome format are supported. Note that the index file should be generated for the reference genome. This can be done by running samtools as follows:\r\n\r\n`$ samtools faidx REFERENCE_GENOME.fasta`\r\n\r\n**SEGMENTS.bed** The BED file for the tumor genome segmentation.\r\n\r\n**NORMAL.bam** The BAM file for the normal sample. The BAM index file should be generated for this file and named NORMAL.bam.bai. This can be done by running\r\n\r\n`$ samtools index NORMAL.bam`\r\n\r\n**TUMOUR.bam** The bam file for the tumour sample. As for the normal this file needs to be indexed.\r\n\r\n**INPUT_BASENAME** The base name of the preprocessed input file to be created.\r\n\r\n**--min_depth** Minimum depth in both normal and tumor sample required to use a site in the analysis.\r\n\r\n**--min_base_qual** Minimum base quality required for each base.\r\n\r\n**--min_map_qual** Minimum mapping quality required for each base.\r\n\r\n**--process_num** Number of processes to launch for preprocessing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRun model\r\n---------\r\nAfter the preprocessed input file is created, we can run the probabilistic model of MixClone by execute:\r\n```\r\n$ MixClone.py run_model INPUT_BASENAME OUTPUT_BASENAME --max_copynumber 6 --subclone_num 2 --max_iters 30 --stop_value 1e-6\r\n```\r\n**INPUT_BASENAME** The base name of the preprocessed input file created in the preprocess step.\r\n\r\n**OUTPUT_BASENAME** The base name of the output file with model parameters estimated to be created.\r\n\r\n**--max_copynumber** The maximum copy number of each segment allows to take.\r\n\r\n**--subclone_num** The number of subclones within the tumor sample. If not provided, go through [1, 5] and select the most likely model.\r\n\r\n**--max_iters** Maximum number of iterations for training.\r\n\r\n**--stop_value** Stop value of the EM algorithm for training. If the change of log-likelihood is lower than this value, stop training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPostprocess\r\n-----------\r\nAfter the output file with model parameters estimated, we can extract various result files from the output file by execute:\r\n```\r\n$ MixClone.py postprocess OUTPUT_BASENAME\r\n```\r\n\r\n**BASENAME** The base name of the output file created in the run_model step.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput files\r\n------------\r\n**\\*.MixClone.segments** The segments file.
